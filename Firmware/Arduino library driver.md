Here are the Arduino library driver names for the mentioned libraries:

1. Wire â†’ `Wire` (Built-in library for I2C communication)
2. LiquidCrystal_PCF8574 â†’ `LiquidCrystal_PCF8574` (For I2C LCD displays)
3. ESP8266WiFi â†’ `ESP8266WiFi` (Built-in ESP8266 WiFi library)
4. BlynkSimpleEsp8266 â†’ `Blynk` (For Blynk IoT platform)
5. DHT â†’ `DHT sensor library` (For DHT11/DHT22 temperature & humidity sensors)

### Installation:
You can install these libraries in the Arduino IDE by following these steps:
1. Open **Arduino IDE.
2. Go to Sketch â†’ Include Library â†’ Manage Libraries.
3. Search for each library name and install it.

Alternatively, you can install them manually:
- Wire is included by default.
- `LiquidCrystal_PCF8574`: Install via Library Manager or from [GitHub](https://github.com/mathertel/LiquidCrystal_PCF8574).
- `ESP8266WiFi` is included with the ESP8266 board package.
- `BlynkSimpleEsp8266`: Install via Library Manager or from [Blynk GitHub](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library).
- `DHT`: Install via Library Manager or from [Adafruit GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library).
